# Arduino-Smart-Attendance-System
This project is an RFID-based attendance system using Arduino and the MFRC522 module. It logs entry and exit times of registered users directly into Excel via PLX-DAQ. Valid cards trigger a green LED, while invalid cards trigger a red LED and buzzer. It helps in automating attendance tracking for students or employees.
